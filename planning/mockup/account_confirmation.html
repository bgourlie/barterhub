Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
License for most of our software; it applies also to any other
work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.
